## Script to parse call_events log files and load them into a database.


Purpose: 

Reads the header of SDRTrunk call_events log, creates a table, imports the call_event log files.

This is an attempt to generate a table and blind copy from csv.  It works well enough to get it into the database for
further db-server-side shuffling.


Please read the script.
